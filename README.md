#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering involves using principles and methods such as designing systems, writing code, conducting tests, validating software and deploying  to create, develop, test and maintain software systems in order to deliver software products that fulfill user needs while also being reliable, efficient, scalable and easy to maintain.
IMPORTANCE
Through software engineering businesses can create fresh offerings and solutions that set them apart from their rivals and open up avenues for growth thus improving uniqueness and creativity.
In software engineering, quality and dependability are key factors. It ensures that software products are trustworthy, consistent and function as intended. This is especially important in sectors like healthcare, finance and transportation where a software malfunction can lead to serious repercussions.
It improves efficiency and productivity through streamlining processes automating tasks and enhancing overall efficiency, software solutions can bring about substantial cost savings and boost competitiveness.
Enhances Security. Software engineering helps ensure that software systems are secure and protect sensitive data from cyber threats, which is essential in today's digital era.
The principles and methods of software engineering facilitate the creation of software systems that are both scalable and easy to maintain. These systems can adjust to evolving user requirements and keep up with advancements in technology.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The NATO Software Engineering Conference, which took place in 1968 in Garmisch, Germany, is regarded as the event that established software engineering as a separate field. This gathering brought together specialists from different domains to address the obstacles in software development and emphasize the importance of a more organized approach. It was at this conference that the term "software engineering" was coined and it set the stage for shaping software engineering principles, methodologies and resources.
The release of "The Mythical Man Month" by Frederick Brooks in 1975 marked a moment in the field of software development. In this book Brooks challenged the conventional wisdom that more programmers on a project would speed up its completion. He highlighted the challenges posed by communication and coordination complexities when scaling up a team. One of the key concepts introduced was the "mythical man month" suggesting that software development is not a straightforward process but rather an intricate and creative undertaking. The books ideas continue to influence engineering practices today by underscoring the value of teams and iterative development approaches.
In 2001 a group of developers came together to sign the Agile Manifesto, which brought about a change in software engineering. Agile methodologies like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) focus on adaptability teamwork and quick iterations. These methods prioritize delivering functional software in cycles, adapting to changes and constantly enhancing processes. The embrace of Agile practices has revolutionized software development with numerous companies adopting its core principles to enhance software quality shorten time to market and boost customer satisfaction.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 Planning Phase
 This entails define project scopes goals and delieverables, identify stakeholders, resources timelines, develop a project plan and budget
    Requirements Gathering Phase.
        Collect and document user requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops
        Define functional and non-functional requirements
        Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document
    Analysis Phase. 
        Analyze the requirements to identify potential solutions
        Evaluate the feasibility of the project
        Develop a preliminary design and architecture
    Design Phase
        Create a detailed design and architecture for the software system
        Develop a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design
        Create a technical specification document
    Implementation Phase
        Write the code for the software system
        Conduct unit testing and integration testing
        Develop a test plan and test cases
    Testing Phase
        Conduct system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing
        Identify and fix defects
        Validate that the software meets the requirements
    Deployment Phase
        Plan and execute the deployment of the software system
        Conduct training and documentation for end-users
        Monitor the system for issues and defects
    Maintenance Phase
        Fix defects and address user issues
        Perform routine maintenance and updates
        Continuously evaluate and improve the software system


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
